# Final_project_ironHack

This project is responding to a need for a compagny to automate the sending of template and notes this is just a test interface made with flask.

I have used to achieve this app the following language and tools :

Jupyter Notebook ( to create the back end part and to test different solution regarding text processing translation ect ...) these are not included but was used to perform the script and processing of the chat bot.
Python ( to handle the back end par of the app)
Flask extension ( to lauch the app)
html and css ( for the website page of the bot)
Javascript ( to allow the bot to interact with user and to send info to the back end part)
